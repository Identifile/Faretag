# Faretag
I want to utilize blockchain to allow easy verification of quotation on the internet.  Basically, I want to make a website that automatically generates web pages that have only the text of official documents (white house press releases, congressional meeting minutes, UN actions etc.) and then allows a user to quote a couple small sections of this text.  When that happens, I want the website to create a new block based on the quote and its source which the website will create a web page for.  Once created, a news organization can link tov the page verifying the legitimacy of their quote and allowing their more rigorous readers to see the context of the quote. 

I also want the website to check and make sure the quote on my website is the same quote that is on theirs, and I want to disallow mismatches.  I think I want to do this when the new block's web page is being created and not allow it to be created if the webpage is different.  I think I also want this to happen every time someone views the page, but I am not sure how feasible that would be.  I also want to make the UI very simple, so I still need to figure out how to check that the actual quote is being published without some organization needing to publish an article before making the tag.   



Note: This is not part of identifile; it is a project I'm doing to learn hashing.
