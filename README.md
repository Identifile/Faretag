I want to utilize blockchain to allow easy verification of quotation on the internet.  Basically, I want to make a website that automatically generates web pages that have only the text of official documents (white house press releases, congressional meeting minutes, UN actions etc.) and then allows a user to quote a couple small sections of this text.  When that happens, I want the website to create a new block based on the quote and its source.  I then want the website to create a web page for this block that a news organization can link to verifying the legitimacy of their quote and allowing their more rigorous readers to see the context of the quote. 



This is not part of identifile; it is a project I'm doing to learn hashing.
